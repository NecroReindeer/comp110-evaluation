# COMP110 Evaluation

##Week 16
This week I mostly focused on practicing programming using C++ for Worksheet 4. As far as problem solving goes, I found interpreting and implementing the maths in part B of the worksheet difficult, despite having a mathematical background. I experienced similar difficulties with actually applying my mathematical knowledge during the Tinkering Audio assignment. I will improve my skill of applying maths to programming and game development by continuing to apply mathematical concepts to problems where appropriate.

##Week 17
This week I mainly focused on preparing my game design pitch, as well as conducting market research and designing my controller for the Hardware Hacking assignment. I enjoyed designing the game for the pitch and thinking about the formal elements of games and how players would interact or percieve the game. I found it difficult to get my ideas down on paper, however. I managed to overcome this by structuring my design in terms of questions about the game.  
I had difficulty thinking of ideas for the Hardware Hacking assignment and performing market research. I didn't really know where to begin with the research, and what was expected. In the end, I ended up identifying areas that may be relevant to my design and chosen game, and doing market research around those.

##Week 18
I have struggle mainly in aspects of time-management and keeping track of what needs doing. For example, I was not aware until the day that our essay proposals were due on Friday, and I was not aware of the fact that the first sprint review for the Hardware Hacking was on Thursday until shortly before it. Consequently, the weekend consisted entirely of getting the essay proposal done for the following Monday. This has also meant that I have gotten behind on the Hardware Hacking, as I thought we were still in the design/research stage, when we were actually supposed to have started making it... (which wasn't helped by the fact my Arduino did not arrive until Wednesday...).
I can attempt to avoid this in future by making a study plan each week, and asking the lecturer for clarification if I am unclear about any formative deadlines.

##Week 19
This week I focused on physically constructing my controller in preparation for next week's sprint review. I experienced significant difficulty in knowing how to start and how to construct a mechanism that actually works the way I intended. Part of this difficulty was due to the only material I had available being cardboard, which meant it was quite flimsy and didn't make very good contacts with the electronics. After a lot of trial and error, and redesigning, I finally got the controller to work relatively reliably.
It took longer than it should have done, as I often became demotivated after it had gone wrong, or when I was stuck for ideas. In order to help avoid this situation in future, I should take a break when I am stuck and come back to it, and, failing that, try to tackle the problem from a new direction.

##Week 20
The focus of this week was working on the maze generator for the group project's first sprint. The main difficulties I had with this were relating to getting used to the differences between C++ and Python, as well as wrangling with the C++ syntax. I had previously implemented the same algorithm in my Kivy game, so after I managed to solve the issues I was having with C++, it was relatively straightforward. I can continue to get myself used to C++ by persevering with writing programs using it, as well as regularly referring to the documentation of C++ and relevant libraries. The more documentation I read for various programming languages, the better I will begin to understand it - currently, I still struggle to understand much of the documentation.

The first sprint was relatively successful, as we managed to complete all of the user stories. There were some issues with communication, which can perhaps be addressed by all members of the group letting each other know what they are working on and the progress they have made regularly.

##Week 21
This week I worked on Worksheet 5. After Ed's live coding demo, I now understand how the A* algorithm works a little better. I have subsequently managed to implement it myself, differently from the live coding demo.
I have continued to struggle with organising my research for the Agile essay, for the same reasons that I struggled with essays last semester. I must develop a plan to allow myself to deal with essays and research better for the future years of the course.
 One of the problems I had was feeling like spaghetti and going everywhere following references and reading fragments of papers, losing track of all of the information and getting confused. In order to better organise my research, I will ensure that I only read and take notes on one paper at a time, and only following up references after I have finished with the current paper.

##Week 22
The group has struggled with communication in the second sprint, and we did not manage to get all of the user stories done. Consequently I have found that the lack of communication has made it difficult to get work done on the group project, hence have not got very much done this sprint. This can be addressed by having daily stand-up meetings with the group.
I have found that explaining how the code I have written works to my group members has allowed me to deepen my understanding of C++ and object oriented programming.

##Easter Break
I struggled with figuring out how to get started with the API Hacking assignment. I think that this is because I was trying to do too many things at once, instead of breaking it down into smaller tasks. In the end, I managed to make progress by focusing only on connecting to the Habitica API. After I have successfully done this, I will then focus on getting the quests from Skyrim. After this, I will link the two together using SKSE.
In order to avoid this problem in future, I will break down assignments into smaller chunks and ensure that I only work on one bit at a time. Sprint planning in trello will help ensure this, as well as provide a means for measuring this target. I can then incorporate this into the study timetables that I am attempting to make each week.

##Week 23
Didn't really do any work for personal reasons.


##Week 24
Didn't really do any work for personal reasons.

##Week 25
This week was a frantic rush to get the Agile Essay finished, as I had not really commenced research or begun writing the essay until now. Rather than being due to the time management issues highlighted in the last reflective report, this was due to personal circumstances resulting in me not being able to spend much time working. 
Regarding time management, however, I made the decision to focus on the large programming projects and spend minimal time on the essays, as they are of a less iterative and time-spanning nature. This decision worked out relatively ok, as my stress levels overall were lower than if I had attempted to juggle all of the assignments at the same time.
I have noticed that I work more productively if I dedicate my time to one assignment at a time, rather than slowly progressing through all of them over the course of several months. Of course, this isn't possible with group projects.

##Week 26
The Heuristic Analysis and Team Review were due at the end of this week. Due to personal reasons, I did not start the Heuristic Analysis or Team Review until this week. Due to the small nature of these assignments, this did not cause me many issues. At first, I was unclear of what was expected for the Heuristic Analysis, but after reviewing others' work in the peer review session I had a better idea of what was expected.
I found writing the Teamwork Report difficult. I struggled to focus on the teamwork skills at the same time as making it personally applicable to me.

##Week 27
This week work was concentrated on the group project and Coding Task 2. Most of the issues we had with communication earlier in the group project were not a problem this week. We communicated on facebook, did pair programming in class, and made pull requests on GitHub to review each others' code. This worked well and allowed our group to tidy up the code and finish with a functional game, albeit with minimal features.
In order to avoid this problem in future, and avoid having a mad rush before the deadline, we should engage in daily standup meetings in future group projects. This will allow us to be aware of what each other was working on and raise any issues that are affecting our productivity.
