# COMP110 Evaluation

##Week 14
This week I mostly focused on practicing programming using C++ for Worksheet 4. As far as problem solving goes, I found interpreting and implementing the maths in part B of the worksheet difficult, despite having a mathematical background. I experienced similar difficulties with actually applying my mathematical knowledge during the Tinkering Audio assignment. I will improve my skill of applying maths to programming and game development by continuing to apply mathematical concepts to problems where appropriate.
